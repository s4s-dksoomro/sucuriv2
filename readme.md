## Laravel Sucuri Admin 

This is a Laravel 5.8 adminpanel starter project with roles-permissions management based 
We've also created almost identical project based on Spatie's Laravel-permission 


## Usage

This is not a package - it's a full Laravel project that you should use as a starter boilerplate, and then add your own custom functionality.

- Clone the repository with `git clone`
- Copy `.env.example` file to `.env` and edit database credentials there
- Run `composer install`
- Run `php artisan key:generate`
- Run `php artisan migrate --seed` (it has some seeded data - see below)
- That's it: launch the main URL and login with default credentials `admin@admin.com` - `password`

This boilerplate has one role (`administrator`), one ability (`users_manage`) and one administrator user.

With that user you can create more roles/abilities/users, and then use them in your code, by using functionality like `Gate` or `@can`, as in default Laravel, or with help of Bouncer's package methods.
